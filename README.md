# Double-Slit Experiment Simulation 

This is a Python-based simulation of the famous **Double-Slit Experiment**, built entirely on a mobile device using **Pyroid3**. The simulation visualizes quantum interference patterns formed by a wavepacket passing through two (or more) slits, demonstrating concepts of quantum mechanics such as **wave-particle duality**, and **interference**.

## Platform
- Developed on: **Pyroid 3** (Android-based Python IDE)

## Features
- Real-time animation of wave interference
- Adjustable simulation parameters via GUI sliders

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (Pyroid 3)
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and optionally `pygame` or `tkinter`

## How to Run
1. Open Pyroid3 on your Android device (or on BlueStacks if you're on PC).
2. Load the script file into your workspace.
3. Run the main script. The GUI will open with sliders and the animation screen.

## Customization
- You can change the amount of slits, slit separation length, and wavelength using sliders.
